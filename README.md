## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

### For Local Installation

First install the server. To do that execute the follwing commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/salesforce-mcp/salesforce-mcp.git
cd salesforce-mcp
uv venv
uv pip install -e .
```

Then, to use this connector locally, you'll need to configure it in your `claude_desktop_config.json` file. Add the following to the `mcpServers` section:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "salesforce": {
            "command": "uv",
            "args": [
                "--directory",
                "[REPO_CLONE_PATH]/salesforce-mcp/src",
                "run",
                "server.py"
            ],
            "env": {
                "USERNAME": "YOUR_SALESFORCE_USERNAME",
                "PASSWORD": "YOUR_SALESFORCE_PASSWORD",
                "SECURITY_TOKEN": "YOUR_SALESFORCE_SECURITY_TOKEN"
            }
        }
    }
```

Make sure to point to the local directory where the repo has been cloned and change that value for the **REPO_CLONE_PATH** 

Replace the placeholder values with your Salesforce credentials:
- `YOUR_SALESFORCE_USERNAME`: Your Salesforce username
- `YOUR_SALESFORCE_PASSWORD`: Your Salesforce password
- `YOUR_SALESFORCE_SECURITY_TOKEN`: Your Salesforce security token
